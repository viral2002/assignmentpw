    <main><section><h2>what is html</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and applications. HTML uses a set of tags to structure the content and define the layout and appearance of web pages.

        HTML documents are made up of elements, which are represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets (&lt; &gt;). The tags define the purpose and structure of different parts of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, and more.</p></section>
    
    
    <section><h2>what is semanitc html</h2>
    <p>Semantic HTML refers to the practice of using HTML elements that convey meaning and structure to web content. It involves choosing the appropriate HTML tags that best represent the purpose and meaning of the content, rather than relying on generic or presentational tags.

        By using semantic HTML, developers provide additional information about the content's meaning, making it more accessible to assistive technologies and search engines. It also helps improve code readability, maintainability, and overall understanding of the document structure.</p></section>
