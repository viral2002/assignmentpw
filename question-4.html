        <li>Screen Readers: Screen readers, such as JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver, read out the content of a web page or application using synthesized speech or Braille output. They allow users with visual impairments to navigate and interact with web content.</li>
        <li>Screen Magnifiers: Screen magnification software enlarges the content displayed on a computer screen, assisting individuals with low vision in reading and interacting with web content. Examples include ZoomText and Windows Magnifier.</li>
        <li>Braille Displays: Braille displays are tactile devices that convert digital text into Braille characters, allowing individuals who are blind or have low vision to read web content through touch. Popular examples include devices from companies like Freedom Scientific and HumanWare.</li>
        <li>Keyboard Alternatives: Individuals with motor impairments may use alternative input devices, such as switches or sip-and-puff devices, to navigate and interact with websites. These devices enable users to perform keyboard functions without physically typing on a traditional keyboard.</li>
