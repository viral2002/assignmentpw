    <p>Tabindex is an attribute in HTML that specifies the order in which elements can be navigated through using the keyboard's tab key. It controls the focus order of interactive elements on a web page. The tabindex attribute assigns a numerical value to elements, determining their position in the tabbing sequence. <br>
    Positive Tabindex (1, 2, 3, etc.): Elements with positive tabindex values are given priority in the tabbing sequence. When the user presses the tab key, the focus moves to the element with the lowest positive tabindex value. Subsequently, the focus moves to elements with higher tabindex values in ascending order. <br>

Zero Tabindex (0): Elements with a tabindex of 0 are included in the natural tab order of the document. They follow the default tabbing sequence based on their position in the HTML structure. This is useful when you want an element to receive focus through the tab key but don't need to prioritize it over other elements. <br>

Negative Tabindex (-1): Elements with a tabindex of -1 are programmatically focusable but are not included in the regular tabbing sequence. They can be targeted for focus using JavaScript but are skipped when navigating with the tab key. This is often used when you need an element to be focusable through scripting but don't want it to interfere with the regular tab order.</p>
