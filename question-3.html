    <p>Web accessibility refers to the inclusive design and development of websites and web applications that can be used by people with disabilities. It aims to ensure equal access to digital content and services for individuals with various impairments, such as visual, hearing, motor, or cognitive disabilities. Web accessibility involves considering both technical and design aspects to make digital content perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users.</p>
    <ol><li>Proper Semantic Structure: Using appropriate HTML markup and semantic elements (e.g., headings, lists, paragraphs) helps convey the structure and meaning of content to assistive technologies.</li>
    <li>Alternative Text (Alt Text): Providing descriptive alt text for images allows individuals using screen readers or other assistive technologies to understand the visual content.</li>
<li>Captions and Transcripts: Including captions for audio and video content and providing transcripts make multimedia accessible to individuals with hearing impairments or those who prefer text-based alternatives.</li></ol>
