    <h1>benifit of using semanitc tag</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Improved Accessibility: Semantic tags provide a clearer and more meaningful structure to web content. This helps assistive technologies, such as screen readers, navigate and interpret the content more accurately, making it more accessible to individuals with disabilities.</li>
        <li>Better SEO: Search engines rely on the structure and semantics of HTML to understand and index web pages. By using semantic tags, you provide search engines with better context and meaning, potentially improving the search engine optimization (SEO) of your website</li>
        <li>Enhanced Readability: Semantic tags make the code more readable and understandable for both developers and designers. Using tags like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; provides a clear visual indication of the purpose and structure of different sections of a web page, making it easier to maintain and update the codebase.</li>
        <li>Code Reusability: With semantic tags, you can create modular and reusable components. By defining the structure and meaning of sections with tags like &lt;article&gt; and &lt;section&gt;, you can easily style and manipulate those components across different pages or sections of your website.</li>
